# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

This project uses [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage dependencies and run scripts.
